      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often heard or been told that writing is like a muscle.
It&amp;rsquo;s one that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hesitant to develop, or very honestly, altogether avoided. When should I start, how to start, and why do my long-form (or short-form even) thoughts matter.
In my caffeine-induced insomnia, I may have found the answers.
Right now. Like this. Probably not, but why let that stop you. So faced with the, I don&amp;rsquo;t know random-desire, to finally start blogging I think it best to handle this the way that I handle nearly everything else.</description>
