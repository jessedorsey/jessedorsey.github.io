**Hey. I'm Jesse ~**

Mostly [I make stuff](/work), design systems, and [write code](https://github.com/jessedorsey). I'm always [reading something](/bookshelf), and I'm trying to get better [at writing](/posts).

Right now, [I'm juggling a few things](/now), eventually, [I'll drop a summer banger](/studio).

This site? It's a snapshot. Part notebook, part [signal booster](https://instagram.com/reallyjesse), all chaos, a place for things that matter.
