When I was younger I thought that the best way to maximize my personal achievement was to maintain maximum optionality. For the me then, freedom came from never being locked into a single path.

As a result, for a long time I held a personal maxim: "No Public Opinions". The internet can be relatively toxic place one with little room for nuance, and worse, no room for growth. A place where a "wrong" thought at any point could prematurely end you.

Now that I’ve gotten older (and, hopefully, a bit wiser), my thinking has started to shift. If you suppress yourself to maintain optionality, are you truly free? At what point does keeping all doors open become a trap? Isn't silence, when you feel something is true, a form of self-restraint that undermines your freedom? Is the thing that you are really protecting, just your fear?

The more I've thought about it, the clearer it's become. Through these means **maximum optionality is a shackle**. But worse than that, it limits the very surface through which you can learn. If you never commit, you never face friction -- if you never face friction, your ideas can’t evolve.

And therein was the solution: I’m already using version control to manage this site. I’m using version control for my own mental map and journaling. Why can’t I use version control to interrogate my beliefs?

So I’m opening up my thinking -- literally.

[/thoughts-on](/thoughts-on) is a public log of my thoughts and ideas. It'll probably be a bit messy, almost certainly quite a lot of nonsense, maybe a few good bits -- but its all open to discussion.
You can read the current version, live here, browse the [git history](https://github.com/jessedorsey/jessedorsey.github.io/tree/main/content/thoughts-on), and join the [discussion](https://github.com/jessedorsey/jessedorsey.github.io/discussions/categories/thoughts-on).

It’s like my mind is open source ~ how fun.
