# ope.

Alright. So the last time, this didn't work. Here we are again -- nearly the same day (in the year) too.

Anyway yeah. A bunch of things have been asking for a site but mine wasn't the best look. I still liked the old theme but there wasn't really any content.

## So I decided to make a site that is at least slightly useful.

A big change is I'm no longer using Hugo. I liked Hugo a bunch, but every time I would come back to it - with how infrequently I blog - I needed to re-learn how everything worked.
So now the site is using Nuxt/Vue.

There are still a bunch of things that need to be worked out, pardon my dust and all that but I'm still keeping the things I liked the most.

- The site is still hosted via github/github pages - with all the source available.[^1]
- The posting format is still basically the same as Hugo
- The [Now](/now) page is still there
- Depending on how NuxtContent works I may still try and adapt hugo (or something like it for building content)[^2]

## New Stuff

So we've got a few new sections - exciting. exciting.

- I'm trying to make good on my statement about including book reports on the books I read. The reports are still in progress but you'll be able to find all of that over on [bookshelf](/bookshelf)
- There are a few little chaotic touches to the site, I'm trying to add more as I think of them.[^3]
- There is a page that chronicles my [work / projects](/work) - mostly so that I can keep track of what I do / have done

[^1]: In part because I'm cheap, but also because as a person who learned web development via "view source" years ago having the source available for people who may want to learn from me feels cool.
[^2]: I'm not really enamored with using a web panel to make content for a static site, even if it's using git as a backend. Terminal feels much more natural for how I use computers
[^3]: Mostly these happen when I don't want to decide on something. The most visible one is probably very obvious if you've ever come back to the site.
