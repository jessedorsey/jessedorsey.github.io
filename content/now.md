Interesting times. Interesting times.

## What are the days like

- Looking out for future adventures, starting what may turn into my digital nomad phase
- Planning new digital murals after TeamLab beat me to the one I wanted to do but couldn't get out. (Theirs is excellent go check it out)
- Catching up for the years of open-source projects I should have put out.
- Actually using my blog [blog](/posts).
- My music is way better, but still not good enough where I want to put it out.
- Working very, very hard coming up with a social media visual aesthetic I can commit to without feeling like it's pretentious.
  -- I should make a post about that.

## What's next

- Mostly trying to figure out where I want to live next.
- I want to spend more time with [Oddity Nook](https://odditynook.com)
- I am going to add proper book reviews to this personal site after I finish something. It'll require me to be more intentional and reflective and all that.
- still itching to finish my digital mural projects ([ask me about them on bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jessedorsey.com)), trying to get better at balancing what I'm doing with what I want to do next

## Reading or Recently Read

I'm so behind on reading yo. All I've touched is code documentation over the last two years. My office is a stack of books.

- [Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit](https://amzn.to/3kxqo4a) : Finding it both irritatingly obtuse but also very interesting.
- [Perfume: The Story of a Murderer](https://amzn.to/3LCwtYX) : Entirely enamored with this book.
- [Conceptual Art](https://amzn.to/3LECFj2) : Opinion TBD

# Why this page

Randomly perusing Hacker News, knee-deep in procrastination I came across the [now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about). It seemed cool and practical, and since this blog is using hugo, pretty easy to implement. So I went further in, waist-deep now, and made this now page.
