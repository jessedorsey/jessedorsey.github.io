# This is my site

There are many sites like it but this one is mine.

I spent a little bit of time looking for new roles and everyone asks for your personal site. I'm 100% convinced that no one looks at personal sites[^1] anymore but I hated how mine looked so here we are. I wanted a nice little snapshot of how I think about stuff and what I like, and most importantly, I wanted people to be able to find stuff if they felt like they needed to.

## Strong opinions, weakly held.

I'm a work in progress, and all of my thoughts on everything aren't always set in stone. As such I'm kind of enamored with the idea of having a place where thoughts can be versioned and discussed. So for the "thoughts-on" section be sure to use the discussions to tell me when I'm wrong about stuff - maybe I'll think of a workflow for opening PRs against what I think later as this gets more tooling.

## Get you a site like this

You can really just clone this one (not the artwork and stuff though) and run it yourself. I liked Hugo a lot for how it was command-line integrated but I didn't like the effort of adjusting it, so this site will have some neat bits later for generating posts and discussion threads and bluesky comment posts and stuff eventually - hopefully I'll get to keep running it all in github pages (because I'm cheap)

~ Cheers.
