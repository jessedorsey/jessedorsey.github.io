      <description>Work is play and play is work.
 What are the days like  Client work, and work developing startups fills most of my day. The last year of building client relationships has turned into a few very, very, interesting project opportunities.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often heard or been told that writing is like a muscle.
It&amp;rsquo;s one that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hesitant to develop, or very honestly, altogether avoided. When should I start, how to start, and why do my long-form (or short-form even) thoughts matter.

 Right now. Like this. Probably not, but why let that stop you.  So faced with the, I don&amp;rsquo;t know random-desire, to finally start blogging I think it best to handle this the way that I handle nearly everything else.</description>
